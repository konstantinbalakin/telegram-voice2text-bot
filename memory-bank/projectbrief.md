# Project Brief: Telegram Voice2Text Bot

## Project Vision

Create a Telegram bot focused on working with voice messages. This is version 2 conceptually, representing a fresh implementation approach.

## Core Objectives

**Primary Goal**: Build a functional Telegram bot that processes and interacts with voice messages.

**Current Status**: Initial exploration and planning phase. No implementation has begun.

## Open Questions

These fundamental questions will shape the project:

1. **Functionality Scope**
   - What specific voice message operations should the bot support?
   - Transcription? Translation? Storage? Analysis? Summarization?
   - Single feature or multiple capabilities?

2. **Technology Choices**
   - Which programming language/platform?
   - Which Telegram bot framework/library?
   - Which voice/audio processing tools?
   - Where will it be deployed?

3. **Use Case**
   - Personal tool or public bot?
   - Expected usage volume and scale?
   - Privacy and data handling requirements?

## Project Context

- **Naming**: "v2" indicates this is a conceptual iteration, not a technical migration from existing code
- **Language Context**: Developer is Russian-speaking, working with international tools
- **Approach**: Structured development from the start using Memory Bank methodology

## Success Criteria

Success at this stage means:
- Clear definition of bot's core functionality
- Technology stack selected and justified
- Architecture approach decided
- First working prototype implemented

## Constraints

Currently identified constraints:
- (To be documented as they emerge)

## Notes

This is a greenfield project starting from scratch. All technical decisions are still open and should be documented in the Memory Bank as they're made.
