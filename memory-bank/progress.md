- Repository pattern provides excellent abstraction for testing
- Type-safe models with `Mapped[]` catch errors at type-check time
- Alembic autogenerate works well with typed models

**Patterns Established**:
- Repository pattern for all database access

- Conventional commits for clear git history
- Feature branch workflow with PR process

**Insights**:
- Well-defined models from planning accelerated implementation
- Test-driven development catches issues immediately
- Separating feat and docs commits aids review

- Per-request database sessions using context manager
- Russian-language user messages throughout

**Insights**:
- Planning phase enabled rapid implementation (1 session for full integration)

- Direct processing (no queue) simplifies MVP significantly
- Bot handlers code complete, ready for real-world testing

### Session #7 (2025-10-16) - Docker Implementation
**Focus**: Docker containerization, docker-compose, Makefile workflow

**Key Learnings**:
- Docker requires iterative optimization (5 drafts to final version)
- Single-stage builds sufficient for this use case (multi-stage overkill)
- Build cache mounting significantly speeds up rebuilds
- Image size (1GB) and build time (4 min) acceptable for ML workload
- Makefile dramatically improves Docker workflow usability

**Patterns Established**:
- requirements.txt as Docker source of truth
- Named volumes for persistent model cache
- Resource limits in docker-compose
- Health checks for container monitoring
- Non-root user for security

**Insights**:
- Docker implementation faster than expected (single session)
- Iterative approach better than trying to get it perfect first time
- Makefile with Russian comments helps user adoption
- PostgreSQL readiness (commented section) enables easy future migration
- MVP now production-ready with minimal additional work

### Session #8+ (2025-10-19) - CI/CD Pipeline Implementation
**Focus**: GitHub Actions workflows, protected branch, automated deployment

**Key Learnings**:
- GitHub Actions provides powerful CI/CD for free (public repos)
- Protected branches enforce quality gates effectively
- Two separate workflows (CI + deploy) better than combined
- Docker Hub integration seamless with GitHub Actions
- VPS deployment automation ready before infrastructure

**Patterns Established**:
- PR-based development with mandatory CI checks
- Automated quality gates (tests, mypy, ruff, black)
- Two-tag Docker strategy (latest + commit SHA)
- Zero-downtime deployment with health checks
- Automatic cleanup of old Docker images

**Code Quality Improvements**:
- Fixed all mypy strict mode errors
- Removed unused imports (ruff)
- Formatted entire codebase (black)
- All CI checks passing on every PR

**Insights**:
- CI/CD implementation faster than expected (completed before VPS)
- Protected main branch prevents mistakes
- Automated testing catches issues early
- Docker Hub caching speeds up builds significantly
- Deployment script ready means instant activation when VPS available
- GitHub Secrets management secure and convenient

**Infrastructure Readiness**:
- Complete automation stack operational
- Only missing piece: VPS server infrastructure
- Can activate production deployment immediately upon VPS setup
- Zero manual deployment steps required after VPS configuration

### Session #6 (2025-10-15) - Bot Launch & Testing
**Focus**: Local bot launch, environment verification, Memory Bank updates

**Key Learnings**:
- Bot launches successfully with all components integrated
- Whisper model loads from local cache (no download needed)
- Database initializes automatically on first run
- Polling mode works smoothly with Telegram API
- Configuration via .env and Pydantic Settings works perfectly

**Patterns Validated**:
- Async initialization sequence (db ‚Üí whisper ‚Üí bot)
- Graceful shutdown with cleanup handlers
- Logging provides clear visibility into bot state
- All unit tests pass, providing confidence

**Insights**:
- MVP code complete in 6 sessions (faster than 6-day estimate)
