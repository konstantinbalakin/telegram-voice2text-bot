# Progress Overview: Telegram Voice2Text Bot

## Timeline & Phase Status
- Project kickoff: 2025-10-12
- Phase 1‚Äì4: ‚úÖ Complete (project setup ‚Üí CI/CD)
- **Phase 4.5**: ‚úÖ Complete (2025-10-24) - Model finalization & provider cleanup
- Phase 5: ‚è≥ Ready to start (VPS acquisition + deployment)
- Current focus (2025-10-24): Code ready, awaiting VPS purchase

## Delivered Milestones

### Core Implementation ‚úÖ
- Core bot with async processing pipeline, quota system, and FasterWhisper integration
- Comprehensive test suite (45 unit tests + integration tests)
- CI enforces mypy, ruff, black, pytest - all passing
- Docker image + docker-compose + Makefile for local/prod deployment
- CI/CD workflows: auto-build, push, deploy to VPS

### Provider Architecture ‚úÖ
- Flexible transcription provider system (ENV-driven selection)
- Benchmark mode for empirical testing
- Fallback strategy support
- **2 Production Providers**: faster-whisper (default), OpenAI API (optional)

### Model Selection ‚úÖ (NEW - 2025-10-24)
- **Comprehensive benchmarking**: 30+ configurations tested across 3 audio samples
- **Production default finalized**: `faster-whisper / medium / int8 / beam1`
  - RTF ~0.3x (3x faster than audio)
  - ~3.5GB RAM peak
  - Excellent quality for Russian language
- **Provider cleanup completed**: Removed openai-whisper (original Whisper)
  - Docker image size reduced ~2-3GB
  - Dependencies: 75 ‚Üí 50 packages
  - Removed torch, openai-whisper from project
- **Documentation updated**: .env.example, README, docs/, Memory Bank
- **Tests added**: Provider-specific unit tests (13 tests)
- **Quality checks**: All passing (mypy, ruff, black, pytest)

## Outstanding Work

### Phase 5: VPS Deployment (Ready to Start)
1. **VPS Purchase** üéØ Next Action
   - Start with Russian VPS (cheaper, ~$5-10/month)
   - Requirements: 6GB+ RAM (4GB minimum, 6GB recommended for buffer)
   - CPU: 2+ cores
   - Storage: 20GB+ (Docker images + models)

2. **Deployment Configuration**
   - Configure GitHub secrets: `VPS_HOST`, `VPS_USER`, `VPS_SSH_KEY`
   - Set Telegram bot token on VPS
   - Trigger CI/CD deployment
   - Verify automated deployment works end-to-end

3. **Production Validation**
   - Monitor real-world metrics (latency, memory usage, RTF)
   - Track user satisfaction / error rates
   - Adjust configuration if needed (e.g., switch to small model if memory tight)
   - Document actual VPS resource usage

4. **Future Enhancement** (Post-Initial Deployment)
   - Migrate to European VPS when OpenAI API access needed
   - Implement hybrid strategy (local + API fallback)
   - Cost optimization based on real usage patterns

## Branch Status

**Current**: `feature/flexible-whisper-providers`
- Ready for final commit + PR
- All changes tested and documented
- Waiting for commit message approval

## Success Metrics

**Technical Readiness**: ‚úÖ 100%
- Code: Production-ready
- Tests: All passing
- Documentation: Up-to-date
- Docker: Optimized

**Deployment Readiness**: ‚è≥ 80%
- Infrastructure: Pending VPS purchase
- CI/CD: Configured, tested locally
- Monitoring: Plan in place
