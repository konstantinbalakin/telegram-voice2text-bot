# Progress: Telegram Voice Bot v2

## Project Timeline

**Started**: 2025-10-12
**Current Phase**: Initial Setup & Planning
**Status**: üü° In Exploration Phase

## What Works

### ‚úÖ Completed

1. **Project Infrastructure** (2025-10-12)
   - Repository created
   - README.md with project description
   - CLAUDE.md for Claude Code guidance
   - Memory Bank system fully initialized
   - All core Memory Bank files created

## What's In Progress

### üîÑ Current Work

1. **Defining Core Functionality**
   - Need to determine primary use case
   - Need to define MVP feature set
   - Need to establish target user

2. **Technology Evaluation**
   - Research programming language options
   - Evaluate Telegram bot frameworks
   - Assess voice processing approaches
   - Determine deployment strategy

## What's Left to Build

### üìã Planning Phase

- [ ] Define specific bot functionality and use case
- [ ] Choose programming language
- [ ] Select Telegram bot framework/library
- [ ] Decide on voice processing approach (API vs. self-hosted)
- [ ] Plan system architecture
- [ ] Design data flow
- [ ] Determine deployment approach

### üèóÔ∏è Implementation Phase (Not Started)

- [ ] Set up development environment
- [ ] Initialize project structure (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
- [ ] Implement basic Telegram bot connection
- [ ] Add voice message receiving capability
- [ ] Integrate voice processing
- [ ] Implement core bot logic
- [ ] Add error handling
- [ ] Create user documentation
- [ ] Set up deployment
- [ ] Launch MVP

### üéØ Future Enhancements (Aspirational)

(To be defined based on MVP scope)

## Known Issues

**Current Blockers**: None - project is in exploration phase

**Technical Debt**: None yet

**Decisions Pending**:
1. What should the bot actually do? (PRIMARY BLOCKER)
2. Which programming language?
3. Which bot framework?
4. Voice processing approach?
5. Deployment platform?

## Milestones

### Milestone 1: Technology Stack Decided ‚è≥
**Target**: TBD
**Status**: Not started
**Criteria**:
- [ ] Core functionality defined
- [ ] Programming language chosen
- [ ] Bot framework selected
- [ ] Voice processing approach decided
- [ ] Deployment strategy determined

### Milestone 2: Development Environment Ready ‚è≥
**Target**: TBD
**Status**: Not started
**Criteria**:
- [ ] Project scaffolding created
- [ ] Dependencies installed
- [ ] Configuration set up
- [ ] Development workflow established

### Milestone 3: Bot Responds to Voice ‚è≥
**Target**: TBD
**Status**: Not started
**Criteria**:
- [ ] Bot can receive voice messages
- [ ] Bot can process them
- [ ] Bot can respond with results

### Milestone 4: MVP Complete ‚è≥
**Target**: TBD
**Status**: Not started
**Criteria**:
- [ ] All MVP features implemented
- [ ] Basic testing done
- [ ] Deployed and accessible
- [ ] Documentation complete

## Velocity & Metrics

**Session Count**: 1 (this is the first session)
**Files Created**: 9
**Lines of Code**: 0 (documentation only so far)

## Decision Evolution

### Major Decisions Made

| Date | Decision | Impact |
|------|----------|--------|
| 2025-10-12 | Initialize Memory Bank before code | Enables structured development from start |
| 2025-10-12 | Full Memory Bank structure | Provides comprehensive framework for tracking decisions |

### Decisions Reversed

(None yet)

## Learning Log

### Session 1 (2025-10-12)
**Focus**: Project initialization and Memory Bank setup

**Key Learnings**:
- Project is named "v2" conceptually, not as a technical migration
- No existing v1 codebase to reference
- Starting completely from scratch with all decisions open
- Developer prefers structured, documented approach

**Insights**:
- Having Memory Bank from day one will capture all decision rationale
- Documentation-first approach suits exploratory phase
- Important to track "why" for technology choices

## Notes

This is the very beginning of the project. The next major step is defining what the bot should actually do, which will drive all subsequent technical decisions.

Current project structure is entirely documentation - no code has been written yet. This is intentional and appropriate for the exploratory phase.

## Next Session Recommendations

1. Use `/workflow:plan` to explore functionality options
2. Define MVP feature set in productContext.md
3. Begin technology evaluation in techContext.md
4. Update activeContext.md with decisions made
