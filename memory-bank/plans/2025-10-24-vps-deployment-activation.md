**Date**: 2025-10-24
**Phase**: Phase 5 - VPS Deployment and Production Validation
**Status**: Code Ready, Awaiting VPS Configuration
**PR**: [#7](https://github.com/konstantinbalakin/telegram-voice2text-bot/pull/7)
**Branch**: `feat/activate-vps-deployment`

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully completed preparation for VPS deployment with a critical discovery about memory requirements. Initial benchmark measurements significantly overestimated RAM usage (3.5GB reported vs ~2GB actual). This finding makes 1GB VPS experiments viable and reduces infrastructure costs.

**Key Accomplishments:**
- ✅ Corrected memory requirements across all documentation (6GB → 2-3GB recommended)
- ✅ Created production-ready `docker-compose.prod.yml`
- ✅ Enhanced deploy workflow with production configuration (medium/int8/beam1)
- ✅ Created comprehensive VPS setup guide (VPS_SETUP.md, 450+ lines)
- ✅ PR #7 ready for review and merge

**Current Status:**
- VPS purchased: 1GB RAM, Russian provider (~$3-5/month)
- VPS state: Clean Ubuntu, SSH not configured
- CI/CD: Code ready, awaiting VPS secrets (VPS_HOST, VPS_USER, VPS_SSH_KEY)

**Next Milestone:** Configure VPS, add GitHub secrets, merge PR → automated deployment

---

## Memory Requirements Discovery (Critical Finding)

### Background

During initial benchmarking (2025-10-22 to 2025-10-24), memory measurements were taken using automated tools. These measurements indicated:
- **Reported**: ~3.5GB RAM peak for medium/int8 model
- **Documented**: 6GB+ recommended, 4GB minimum

### The Discovery

User performed manual system monitoring during production testing and observed:
- **Actual**: ~2GB RAM peak for medium/int8 model
- **Difference**: 43% lower than initial measurements

### Root Cause

Initial benchmarks likely used `psutil` or similar tools that:
- Include cached memory in measurements
- Count shared libraries multiple times
- Don't reflect steady-state production usage

Manual observation via system monitor (Activity Monitor on macOS / `htop` on Linux) showed true working set memory.

### Impact

**Infrastructure:**
- 1GB VPS experiment now more realistic (though may still need 2GB)
- Cost savings: 2-3GB VPS sufficient vs 6GB+ previously planned
- Monthly cost: ~$5-10 vs ~$15-20

**Documentation Updates:**
- `memory-bank/projectbrief.md`: Resource constraints section
- `memory-bank/techContext.md`: Production configuration
- `memory-bank/progress.md`: Model selection specs
- `memory-bank/activeContext.md`: Resources and risks
- `README.md`: Production configuration section
- `.env.example`: Memory specifications in comments

### Lessons Learned

1. **Trust Real-World Testing**: Benchmark tools can be misleading
2. **Manual Verification**: System monitor provides ground truth
3. **Document Methodology**: Always note how measurements were taken
4. **Conservative Estimates**: Initial 6GB recommendation had good safety margin, but was too conservative

---

## Production Configuration Finalized

### 1. docker-compose.prod.yml

**Created**: Production-optimized Docker Compose configuration

**Key Features:**
```yaml
services:
  bot:
    image: ${IMAGE_NAME:-konstantinbalakin/telegram-voice2text-bot:latest}
    # Uses pre-built images from Docker Hub, not local build

    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: '2.0'
          memory: 2G  # Adjusted based on actual 2GB usage
        reservations:
          cpus: '0.25'
          memory: 256M
```

**Design Decisions:**
- **Pre-built images**: Faster deployment, consistent with CI/CD
- **IMAGE_NAME variable**: Supports versioning and rollback
- **2GB memory limit**: Based on actual usage + safety margin
- **Low reservation**: Allows efficient resource sharing on VPS

### 2. Deploy Workflow Enhancement

**File**: `.github/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml`

**Changes:**

**Before** (line 76-87):
```bash
cat > .env <<EOF
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=${{ secrets.TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN }}
BOT_MODE=polling
WHISPER_MODEL_SIZE=base  # ❌ Wrong model
WHISPER_DEVICE=cpu
WHISPER_COMPUTE_TYPE=int8
DATABASE_URL=sqlite+aiosqlite:////app/data/bot.db
LOG_LEVEL=INFO  # ❌ Exposes bot token in logs
TRANSCRIPTION_TIMEOUT=120
MAX_CONCURRENT_WORKERS=3
EOF
```

**After** (line 76-110):
```bash
cat > .env <<EOF
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=${{ secrets.TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN }}
BOT_MODE=polling

# Transcription Provider Configuration
WHISPER_PROVIDERS=["faster-whisper"]
WHISPER_ROUTING_STRATEGY=single
PRIMARY_PROVIDER=faster-whisper

# FasterWhisper Production Configuration (medium/int8/beam1)
FASTER_WHISPER_MODEL_SIZE=medium  # ✅ Correct production model
FASTER_WHISPER_DEVICE=cpu
FASTER_WHISPER_COMPUTE_TYPE=int8
FASTER_WHISPER_BEAM_SIZE=1
FASTER_WHISPER_VAD_FILTER=true

# Database
DATABASE_URL=sqlite+aiosqlite:////app/data/bot.db

# Processing
MAX_QUEUE_SIZE=100
MAX_CONCURRENT_WORKERS=3
TRANSCRIPTION_TIMEOUT=120
MAX_VOICE_DURATION_SECONDS=300

# Quota
DEFAULT_DAILY_QUOTA_SECONDS=60

# Logging
LOG_LEVEL=WARNING  # ✅ Hides bot token in HTTP logs (security)

# Benchmark Mode
BENCHMARK_MODE=false
EOF
```

**Key Improvements:**
1. ✅ Correct model: `medium` (not `base`)
2. ✅ Complete provider configuration
3. ✅ Security: `LOG_LEVEL=WARNING` prevents token leaks in logs
4. ✅ All production variables included
5. ✅ Production-ready defaults

### 3. Production Environment Variables

**Complete Configuration:**

| Variable | Value | Rationale |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| `FASTER_WHISPER_MODEL_SIZE` | `medium` | Production default after benchmarking |
| `FASTER_WHISPER_COMPUTE_TYPE` | `int8` | Best speed/quality balance on CPU |
| `FASTER_WHISPER_BEAM_SIZE` | `1` | Greedy decoding, 2x faster than beam5 |
| `FASTER_WHISPER_VAD_FILTER` | `true` | Filters silence, better for noisy audio |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `WARNING` | Security: hides bot token in HTTP logs |
| `MAX_CONCURRENT_WORKERS` | `3` | Memory constraint (3 × 2GB = ~6GB max) |
| `TRANSCRIPTION_TIMEOUT` | `120` | Sufficient for 5-minute audio |

## Technical Decisions Log

### Decision 1: docker-compose.prod.yml Structure

**Date**: 2025-10-24

**Options Considered:**
1. Build on VPS (use `build:` directive)
2. Use pre-built images from Docker Hub
3. Hybrid (build locally, push manually)

**Decision**: Option 2 - Pre-built images from Docker Hub

**Rationale:**
- ✅ Consistent with CI/CD automation
- ✅ Faster deployment (no build step on VPS)
- ✅ Same image tested in CI
- ✅ Supports IMAGE_NAME for versioning
- ✅ Easy rollback to previous SHA tags

**Implementation:**
```yaml
image: ${IMAGE_NAME:-konstantinbalakin/telegram-voice2text-bot:latest}
```

**Trade-offs:**
- ❌ Requires Docker Hub (but already configured)
- ❌ Larger initial download (but cached after first pull)

---

### Decision 2: Memory Limits in Production Compose

**Date**: 2025-10-24

**Options Considered:**
1. No limits (let Docker use all available)
2. 3.5GB limit (based on initial benchmarks)
3. 2GB limit (based on actual testing)
4. 1GB limit (aggressive, may cause OOM)

**Decision**: Option 3 - 2GB limit

**Rationale:**
- ✅ Based on actual production testing (~2GB peak)
- ✅ Allows VPS to run other services if needed
- ✅ Prevents runaway memory usage
- ✅ Realistic for 2-3GB VPS configurations

**Implementation:**
```yaml
deploy:
  resources:
    limits:
      memory: 2G
    reservations:
      memory: 256M  # Low floor for efficiency
```

**Risk Mitigation:**
- If OOM occurs, user can quickly scale VPS RAM via panel
- `docker stats` monitoring included in VPS_SETUP.md
- 2GB provides safety margin over observed ~2GB peak

---

### Decision 3: LOG_LEVEL=WARNING in Production

**Date**: 2025-10-24

**Options Considered:**
1. INFO (development default)
2. WARNING (hide most logs)
3. ERROR (only errors)
4. DEBUG (maximum verbosity)

**Decision**: Option 2 - WARNING

**Rationale:**
- ✅ **Security**: Hides HTTP logs that contain bot token in URLs
- ✅ Production best practice
- ✅ Reduces log volume
- ✅ Still shows warnings and errors
- ✅ Easier troubleshooting than ERROR-only

**Security Note:**
`python-telegram-bot` logs full HTTP request URLs at DEBUG and INFO levels. These URLs contain the bot token as a query parameter. Using WARNING prevents token leaks in logs.

**Example of hidden log** (INFO level):
```
INFO:httpx:HTTP Request: POST https://api.telegram.org/bot123456:ABC-TOKEN/sendMessage
```

**Trade-off:**
- ❌ Less verbose logs for debugging
- ✅ Can temporarily change to INFO if needed for troubleshooting

---

### Decision 4: 1GB VPS Experiment Strategy

**Date**: 2025-10-24

**Options Considered:**
1. Start with 4GB VPS (safe, higher cost)
2. Start with 2GB VPS (balanced)
3. Start with 1GB VPS (experimental, low cost)

**Decision**: Option 3 - 1GB VPS experiment

**Rationale:**
- ✅ Memory discovery (2GB actual) makes it viable
- ✅ Cost optimization (~$3-5/month vs ~$10-15)
- ✅ Quick upgrade path via VPS panel
- ✅ Validates minimum requirements empirically
- ✅ Russian VPS provider (cheap, suitable for testing)

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Monitoring guide in VPS_SETUP.md (Phase 7)
- Upgrade instructions documented
- Expected behavior: may hit OOM during transcription
- Acceptance: Willing to upgrade to 2GB if needed

**Success Criteria:**
- If bot handles 30-second audio without OOM → success
- If OOM occurs → upgrade to 2GB, document findings
- If 2GB still insufficient → revisit memory investigation

---

### Decision 5: VPS_SETUP.md Comprehensiveness

**Date**: 2025-10-24

**Options Considered:**
1. Brief guide (link to external resources)
2. Moderate guide (key steps, external links for details)
3. Comprehensive guide (everything needed, minimal external deps)

**Decision**: Option 3 - Comprehensive guide (450+ lines)

**Rationale:**
- ✅ Reduces friction for deployment
- ✅ Single source of truth
- ✅ Accounts for beginner VPS users
- ✅ Includes troubleshooting
- ✅ Permanent reference for future deployments
- ✅ Demonstrates attention to detail

**Content Included:**
- SSH key generation (ed25519)
- Docker installation (official script)
- GitHub Secrets setup
- First deployment walkthrough
- Resource monitoring commands
- Security hardening (optional)
- Common issues and solutions

**Trade-off:**

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Memory Benchmarking Methodology

**Lesson**: Automated benchmark tools can significantly overestimate memory usage.

**What Happened**:
- Initial benchmarks: ~3.5GB peak
- Actual production: ~2GB peak
- Difference: 43% overestimate

**Why It Matters**:
- Infrastructure sizing decisions affected
- Cost implications (~2x budget increase)
- Risk assessment skewed conservative

**Best Practice Going Forward**:
- Always validate benchmarks with manual system monitoring
- Document measurement methodology
- Use multiple measurement tools
- Test under realistic workloads
- Separate cached memory from working set

**Applied to Future**:
- Memory Bank now includes "actual production testing" notes
- Documentation clearly states measurement method
- Conservative estimates still valuable, but labeled as such

---

### 2. Production Configuration Evolution

**Lesson**: Deploy workflow configuration requires careful attention to production defaults.

**What Happened**:
- Initial workflow used `base` model (development default)
- Production uses `medium` model (benchmarked choice)
- LOG_LEVEL=INFO exposed bot token in logs (security issue)

**Why It Matters**:
- Wrong model in production → quality degradation
- INFO logging → security vulnerability
- Missing variables → container fails to start

**Best Practice Going Forward**:
- Separate development and production .env templates
- Document each production variable with rationale
- Security review of all logged information
- Test production configuration in staging

**Applied to This Project**:
- Created comprehensive .env generation in deploy workflow
- Added LOG_LEVEL=WARNING for security
- Documented every production variable
- VPS_SETUP.md includes configuration review step

---

### 3. Documentation ROI

**Lesson**: Comprehensive documentation (VPS_SETUP.md) has high return on investment.

**Time Investment**:
- Writing VPS_SETUP.md: ~1 hour
- Total: 450+ lines, 8 phases, troubleshooting

**Expected Return**:
- First deployment: Saves 2-3 hours (fewer mistakes, no research)
- Future deployments: Saves 1-2 hours each
- Other projects: Reusable template
- Team members: No knowledge bottleneck

**ROI Calculation**:
- First use: 1 hour investment → 2-3 hours saved = 2-3x ROI
- 5 future uses: 1 hour investment → 10+ hours saved = 10x+ ROI

**Best Practice Going Forward**:
- Invest in documentation during first implementation
- Structure for reusability (phases, templates)
- Include troubleshooting from the start
- Treat documentation as first-class deliverable

---

### 4. VPS Sizing Strategy

**Lesson**: Start minimal, validate empirically, scale as needed.

**Strategy**:
1. Start with 1GB VPS (lowest cost)
2. Monitor actual usage
3. Upgrade only if necessary
4. Document findings

**Why This Works**:
- Cloud VPS: RAM upgrades are instant (1-2 minutes)
- Cost optimization: Pay only for what's needed
- Empirical validation: Real-world data beats estimates
- Risk low: Easy rollback/upgrade

**Applied to This Project**:
- Starting with 1GB (~$3-5/month)
- Expecting possible upgrade to 2GB (~$7-10/month)
- Monitoring guide in VPS_SETUP.md
- Acceptance of potential OOM during validation

**Contrast to Previous Plan**:
- Old plan: Start with 6GB VPS (~$15-20/month)
- New plan: Start with 1GB, scale to 2GB if needed
- Savings: 50-70% monthly cost

---

### 5. CI/CD Preparedness

**Lesson**: Existing CI/CD infrastructure accelerated VPS deployment preparation.

**Existing Foundation** (from 2025-10-17):
- CI workflow operational
- Docker Hub integration
- Build workflow created
- Secrets management configured

**Impact on This Work**:
- No need to setup basic CI/CD
- Could focus on production configuration
- Deploy workflow enhancement (not creation)
- Confidence in automated deployment

**Best Practice Going Forward**:
- Invest in CI/CD early (Phases 1-3)
- Production deployment becomes incremental
- Each phase builds on previous work
- Well-documented phases enable parallel work

---
