## Current Status

**Phase**: Phase 5 - VPS Deployment and Production Validation
**Date**: 2025-10-24
**Stage**: VPS purchased (1GB RAM), preparing for SSH configuration and CD activation
**Branch**: `main` (feature/flexible-whisper-providers merged)
**Latest Activities**: Memory requirements corrected (6GB â†’ 2GB actual), VPS setup in progress

## Production Configuration Finalized âœ…

**Decision**: `faster-whisper / medium / int8 / beam1`

After comprehensive manual analysis of benchmark transcripts (30+ configurations tested across 7s, 24s, 163s audio samples):

- **Performance**: RTF ~0.3x (3x faster than audio duration)
  - 7s audio â†’ ~2s processing
  - 30s audio â†’ ~10s processing
  - 60s audio â†’ ~20s processing
- **Quality**: Excellent for Russian language, good accuracy on long informal speech
- **Resources**: ~2GB RAM peak (actual production testing, not 3.5GB as initially measured)
- **Tradeoff**: Prioritized quality over speed for better user experience
- **Note**: Initial benchmark memory measurements were incorrect (3.5GB); real-world testing shows ~2GB peak

Alternative faster configurations (tiny, small) showed unacceptable quality degradation (22-78% similarity on some samples).

## Recent Changes (2025-10-24)

### Memory Requirements Correction âœ… NEW
- **Discovered**: Initial benchmark memory measurements (~3.5GB) were incorrect
- **Actual**: Production testing shows ~2GB RAM peak for medium/int8 model
- **Impact**: 1GB VPS experiment now more realistic (still may need 2GB)
- **Documentation**: Updating all files with correct memory requirements

### VPS Deployment Started ðŸ”„ NEW
- **VPS Purchased**: 1GB RAM, Russian provider (~$3-5/month)
- **Strategy**: Start minimal, validate actual usage, scale if needed
- **Status**: Clean Ubuntu, SSH not configured yet
- **Next**: SSH setup, Docker installation, CD pipeline activation

### Provider Architecture Cleanup âœ…
- **Removed**: openai-whisper provider (original Whisper)
  - Deleted: `src/transcription/providers/whisper_provider.py`
  - Deleted: `tests/unit/test_whisper_service.py`
  - Removed from factory, router, all imports

- **Dependencies Optimized**:
  - Removed: `openai-whisper`, `torch` from pyproject.toml
  - `requirements-docker.txt`: 75 â†’ 50 dependencies (~2-3GB Docker image savings)
  - Deleted: `requirements-full.txt`, `docker-compose.prod.yml` (obsolete)

- **Updated Defaults**:
  - `FASTER_WHISPER_MODEL_SIZE`: base â†’ **medium**
  - `FASTER_WHISPER_BEAM_SIZE`: 5 â†’ **1** (greedy decoding, faster)
  - All documentation updated with production benchmarks

- **Provider Tests Added**:
  - `tests/unit/test_faster_whisper_provider.py` (6 tests)
  - `tests/unit/test_openai_provider.py` (7 tests)
  - All 45 unit tests passing âœ…

### Quality Assurance âœ…
- âœ… mypy: No type errors
- âœ… ruff: All checks passed
- âœ… black: Code formatted
- âœ… pytest: 45/45 tests passing

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Complete Documentation Updates**: Finish correcting memory requirements across all files
2. **VPS SSH Configuration**: Set up SSH key-based authentication for GitHub Actions
3. **Docker Installation**: Install Docker on VPS server
4. **CD Pipeline Activation**: Add VPS secrets to GitHub, trigger first automated deployment
5. **Production Validation**: Monitor actual resource usage on 1GB VPS, scale if needed

## Active Risks / Considerations

- **1GB RAM Risk**: May hit OOM during transcription (actual ~2GB needed), but VPS can be scaled quickly
- **Initial Benchmark Error**: Memory measurements in benchmarks were inflated (~3.5GB vs ~2GB actual)
- **Cold Start**: First transcription will be slow (model loading ~1.5GB); subsequent calls fast
- **Long Audio**: 2+ minute audio will take 30-40s; consider UX messaging ("processing long audio...")
- **Fallback Strategy**: OpenAI provider available but not configured by default (cost concerns)
