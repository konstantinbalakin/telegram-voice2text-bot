# Active Context: Telegram Voice Bot v2

## Current Status

**Phase**: Planning Complete → Ready for Implementation
**Date**: 2025-10-12
**Stage**: Implementation Phase 1 - Project Setup

## What Just Happened (Session #1)

### Planning & Design (2025-10-12)

1. ✅ **Requirements Defined**
   - User provided detailed vision for voice transcription bot
   - MVP: Accept voice → transcribe with local Whisper → return text
   - Future: Summary, quota system, billing, unlimited access

2. ✅ **Technology Stack Selected**
   - Language: Python 3.11+
   - Bot: python-telegram-bot v22.5
   - Whisper: **faster-whisper v1.2.0** (NOT openai-whisper!)
   - DB: SQLAlchemy + SQLite→PostgreSQL
   - Architecture: Hybrid Queue (Option 3)

3. ✅ **Critical Discovery**
   - Initially proposed openai-whisper (outdated: 20231117)
   - Researched and found faster-whisper 1.2.0 (August 2025)
   - **4x faster, 75% less memory, same accuracy**
   - This significantly improves MVP viability

4. ✅ **Comprehensive Planning**
   - `/workflow:plan` executed with deep analysis
   - 3 implementation options evaluated
   - Detailed 6-day implementation plan created
   - All Memory Bank files updated

5. ✅ **Memory Bank Fully Documented**
   - `plans/2025-10-12-mvp-hybrid-bot-plan.md` - Complete implementation plan
   - `techContext.md` - Technology decisions with rationale
   - `systemPatterns.md` - Architectural design and patterns
   - `activeContext.md` - This file (current state)

## Current Focus

**Immediate**: Begin MVP Implementation - Phase 1 (Project Setup)

**Next Actions**:
1. Initialize Poetry project structure
2. Create directory structure
3. Setup dependencies
4. Create configuration files
5. Initialize git repository

## Working Assumptions (CONFIRMED)

- ✅ Telegram bot for voice message transcription
- ✅ Local Whisper model (faster-whisper, no API costs)
- ✅ Python 3.11+ with asyncio architecture
- ✅ Quota system (60 sec/day free, expandable)
- ✅ Polling for local dev → Webhook for VPS
- ✅ Docker containerization planned
- ✅ Future CI/CD to VPS

## Recent Learnings

### Session #1 Key Insights

**Technical**:
- faster-whisper is THE choice for local Whisper (4x faster)
- Hybrid queue architecture balances MVP speed with scale path
- ThreadPoolExecutor pattern critical for CPU-bound Whisper
- Semaphore (max 3) prevents OOM on modest hardware

**Project**:
- User has clear product vision with phased approach
- Russian-speaking developer, international tools
- Values structured process (Memory Bank from day zero)
- Focus on cost optimization (local models, no API fees)

**Architecture**:
- Start simple (monolith), but structure for growth
- Queue abstraction allows Redis migration later
- Repository pattern for DB flexibility
- Configuration-driven (polling/webhook switch)

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Today/Tomorrow)

**Phase 1: Project Setup** (~0.5 day)
```bash
# 1. Initialize Poetry
poetry init
poetry add python-telegram-bot faster-whisper sqlalchemy...

# 2. Create structure
mkdir -p src/{bot,processing,transcription,storage,quota}
mkdir -p tests/{unit,integration}

# 3. Setup configs
cp .env.example .env
# Add bot token

# 4. Git init
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial project setup"
```

**Use**: `/workflow:execute` to begin implementation

### Short Term (This Week)

- **Days 1-2**: Database models + Whisper service
- **Days 2-3**: Queue system + Bot handlers
- **Days 4-5**: Integration + Testing
- **Days 5-6**: Docker + Local deployment

### Medium Term (Next 2 Weeks)

- VPS deployment with webhook
- PostgreSQL migration
- Basic monitoring

### Long Term (Future Sprints)

- Text processing pipeline (summary, etc.)
- Payment integration
- CI/CD pipeline
- Horizontal scaling

## Open Questions (RESOLVED)

### ~~Product Questions~~ ✅ ANSWERED
- ✅ Primary use case: Voice transcription with local Whisper
- ✅ Target users: Initially personal, scalable to public
- ✅ Core flow: Voice → Queue → Transcribe → Respond

### ~~Technical Questions~~ ✅ ANSWERED
- ✅ Language: Python 3.11+
- ✅ Voice processing: faster-whisper (local, no API)
- ✅ State: Stateful (SQLite → PostgreSQL)
- ✅ Deployment: Docker + VPS

### New Questions (Implementation Phase)
- Where to get Telegram Bot Token? → @BotFather
- Which Whisper model size for testing? → base (recommended)
- VPS provider preference? → TBD (DigitalOcean, Hetzner, etc.)

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### Established Patterns

1. **Configuration Management**
   - Pydantic Settings for type-safe config
   - Environment variables via `.env`
   - No hardcoded values

2. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful degradation
   - User-friendly error messages (Russian)
   - Comprehensive logging

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - pytest + pytest-asyncio
   - >70% coverage target
   - Integration tests for critical paths

4. **Code Quality**
   - black formatting
   - ruff linting
   - mypy type checking
   - Conventional commits

### Architectural Principles

- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear component boundaries
- **Async First**: Leverage Python asyncio throughout
- **Thread Pool Isolation**: Block blocking code (Whisper)
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstract DB access
- **Producer-Consumer**: Queue-based processing

## Project Insights

### Metacognitive Observations

1. **Planning Paid Off**
   - Deep analysis prevented choosing outdated library (openai-whisper)
   - Option comparison led to optimal architecture choice
   - Risk assessment identified and mitigated key concerns

2. **Technology Research Critical**
   - faster-whisper discovery = 4x performance improvement
   - Version checking saved future refactoring
   - PyPI research ensured modern stack

3. **Phased Approach Smart**
   - MVP → Docker → VPS → CI/CD is logical progression
   - Each phase builds on previous
   - Clear milestones for validation

4. **Documentation First**
   - Having Memory Bank before code feels unusual but valuable
   - All decisions captured with rationale
   - Future Claude instances have full context

## Current Blockers

**None** - Ready to proceed with implementation!

## Session Summary

**Time Spent**: Planning and architecture design
**Decisions Made**: 6 major (language, framework, whisper, architecture, DB, deployment)
**Files Created**: 1 plan document, 3 Memory Bank files updated
**Code Written**: 0 lines (intentional - planning phase)

**Confidence Level**: **85%** - Strong plan, known risks, clear path forward

## Notes

This is the END of the planning phase and START of implementation. All major decisions are made, documented, and approved. The implementation plan in `memory-bank/plans/2025-10-12-mvp-hybrid-bot-plan.md` is the authoritative guide for building the MVP.

**Key Success Factor**: We caught the openai-whisper version issue early. Using faster-whisper 1.2.0 will significantly improve MVP performance and reduce resource requirements.

Next session should begin with `/workflow:execute` to start Phase 1: Project Setup.
