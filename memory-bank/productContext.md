# Product Context: Telegram Voice Bot v2

## Problem Space

### The Need

Voice messages in Telegram are a popular communication format, but they have limitations:
- Cannot be quickly scanned like text
- Difficult to search or reference later
- May not be accessible in all situations (noise, hearing impairment, language barriers)
- Hard to organize and catalog

**Open Question**: Which of these problems is this bot primarily solving? (To be defined)

## Target Users

**Currently Undefined** - Potential user profiles:
- Personal use by developer
- Small group/community tool
- Public bot for general Telegram users
- Specific use case (accessibility, productivity, content management, etc.)

**Decision Needed**: Define target user and their specific pain points

## Product Vision

### What Success Looks Like

*To be defined based on chosen functionality*

A successful version 1.0 would:
- [ ] Process voice messages reliably
- [ ] Provide clear value to target users
- [ ] Operate within Telegram's bot capabilities
- [ ] Meet performance/scale requirements (TBD)

### Core User Experience

**Interaction Model** (to be decided):
- Bot commands?
- Inline queries?
- Chat interactions?
- Group vs. private chat?

**User Flow** (to be designed):
1. User sends voice message to bot (or?)
2. Bot processes... (how? what feedback?)
3. Bot responds with... (what output?)

## Value Proposition

**To Be Defined**

Key questions:
- What does this bot do that users can't easily do otherwise?
- Why would someone use this bot vs. alternatives?
- What's the core "job to be done"?

## Scope Considerations

### Potential Features (Brainstorm)

Voice Processing:
- Transcription (speech-to-text)
- Translation
- Summarization
- Speaker identification
- Sentiment analysis
- Audio format conversion
- Storage/archival
- Search capability

Integration:
- Forward to other services
- Database storage
- Analytics
- User preferences

**Decision Needed**: Which features are MVP vs. future enhancements?

## Product Principles

(To be established as the product vision clarifies)

## Non-Goals

(To be defined - what this bot intentionally won't do)

## Notes

This document should evolve rapidly as the core use case and functionality are defined. The product vision will shape all technical decisions.
