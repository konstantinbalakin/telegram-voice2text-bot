# Product Context: Telegram Voice2Text Bot

## Problem Space ✅ DEFINED

### The Primary Need

Voice messages in Telegram are popular but have key limitations that this bot addresses:

**Target Problem**: Voice messages cannot be quickly scanned, searched, or referenced like text. Users need to listen to entire messages even for brief information.

**Secondary Problems**:
- Time inefficiency: Cannot skim content
- Accessibility: Not suitable in all situations (noise, meetings, hearing impairment)
- Searchability: Hard to find specific information later
- Language barriers: Difficult to translate or process

**Solution**: Instant voice-to-text transcription with optional summarization

## Product Vision ✅ ESTABLISHED

### What Success Looks Like

**Version 1.0 (MVP)** - A bot that:
- ✅ Accepts voice messages in private chats
- ✅ Transcribes accurately using local Whisper model
- ✅ Returns text within 30 seconds for 1-minute audio
- ✅ Manages usage via daily quota system (60 sec/day free)
- ✅ Provides clear status updates during processing
- ✅ Handles errors gracefully with user-friendly messages

**Version 2.0 (Enhanced)** - Adds:
- Text summarization and key points extraction
- Payment integration for additional quota
- Webhook mode for production deployment
- Usage analytics and history

**Version 3.0 (Advanced)** - Scales to:
- Multi-language support beyond Russian
- Group chat support
- Integration with other services
- Advanced text processing options

### Core User Experience ✅ DESIGNED

**Interaction Model**: Direct chat with bot
- Private chat focused (groups in future)
- Simple command-based interface
- Minimal learning curve

**Primary User Flow**:
1. **User** sends voice message to bot
2. **Bot** immediately acknowledges with "⏳ Обрабатываю..." (Processing...)
3. **Bot** queues transcription task (async)
4. **Bot** processes in background (10-30 seconds)
5. **Bot** updates status message with transcribed text
6. **User** receives text, can copy/search/reference

**Quota Check Flow**:
1. User sends voice message
2. Bot checks remaining daily quota
3. If exceeded → Error message with upgrade options
4. If available → Process normally

**Error Scenarios**:
- Quota exceeded: "❌ Превышен дневной лимит..."
- Queue full: "⚠️ Сервис перегружен. Попробуйте через 30 секунд."
- Processing timeout: "❌ Не удалось обработать. Попробуйте снова."
- Too long: "❌ Максимальная длительность: 5 минут"

## Value Proposition ✅ DEFINED

**Core Value**: Instant, private voice-to-text transcription without API costs

**Key Differentiators**:

- `/help` - Usage instructions, feature overview
- *Send voice* - Primary interaction, triggers transcription

**Future Commands**:
- `/summary` - Toggle auto-summarization
- `/language` - Set preferred language
- `/history` - View recent transcriptions
- `/upgrade` - Purchase additional quota

### Message Formats

**Tone**: Friendly, concise, professional

### Performance Expectations

Users expect:
- **Fast response**: Status within 1 second
- **Reasonable processing**: <30 seconds for 1-minute audio
- **Reliability**: 95%+ success rate
- **Clarity**: Always know what's happening

## Success Metrics

### MVP Success Criteria

**Functional**:
- Bot accepts and transcribes voice messages
- Quota system works correctly
- Error handling is graceful

**Performance**:
- 95% of 1-minute audio transcribed in <30 seconds
- Queue handles 10 concurrent users
- Zero downtime during normal operation

**User Satisfaction**:
- Users understand how to use (no confused questions)
- Errors are self-explanatory
- Free tier meets casual use needs

### Future Metrics (Phase 2+)

- Daily active users (DAU)
- Transcription accuracy rate
- Average processing time
- Quota upgrade conversion rate
- User retention (7-day, 30-day)

## Notes

**Key Insight**: The decision to focus on transcription-only MVP (no summarization yet) allows for faster delivery while maintaining extensibility. The text processing pipeline can be added later without architectural changes.

**User Language**: All user-facing messages in Russian, but codebase and documentation in English for broader accessibility.

**Monetization Strategy**: Freemium model with generous free tier ensures sustainability while remaining accessible. Payment integration is Phase 2 after validating core value proposition.
