- Focus on cost optimization (local models, no API fees)

**Architecture**:
- Start simple (monolith), but structure for growth
- Queue abstraction allows Redis migration later
- Repository pattern for DB flexibility
- Configuration-driven (polling/webhook switch)

### Session #2 Key Insights

**Implementation**:
- Python package structure established correctly
- Pydantic Settings provides excellent type safety
- Poetry manages dependencies effectively
- Project renamed for clarity (voice2text more descriptive)

**Patterns Established**:
- Configuration via environment variables + Pydantic
- Logging configured from the start
- Async-first architecture
- Clean separation of concerns by package

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Current Session)

**Phase 2: Database & Models** (~1 day)
```python
# 1. Define models in src/storage/models.py
class User(Base):
    telegram_id, username, daily_quota, is_unlimited, etc.

class Usage(Base):
    user_id, voice_duration, transcription_text, created_at

class Transaction(Base):  # Future billing
    user_id, amount, quota_added, status

# 2. Setup Alembic
alembic init alembic
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "initial schema"
alembic upgrade head

# 3. Implement repositories
UserRepository, UsageRepository with async methods

# 4. Write tests
test_database.py, test_repositories.py
```

**Phase 3: Whisper Integration** (~0.5 day)
```python
# src/transcription/whisper_service.py
class WhisperService:
    - Model initialization (faster-whisper)
    - Thread pool executor (max 3 workers)
    - async transcribe() with timeout
    - Error handling

# src/transcription/audio_handler.py
class AudioHandler:
    - Download from Telegram
    - Format validation
    - Temporary file management
```

### Short Term (This Week)

- **Days 1-2**: Complete database layer + Whisper service ← Current focus
- **Day 3**: Implement processing queue system
- **Day 4**: Build bot handlers and middleware
- **Days 5-6**: Integration testing and Docker setup

### Medium Term (Next 2 Weeks)

- VPS deployment with webhook mode

## Open Questions (Implementation Phase)

### Answered ✅
- ✅ Where to get Telegram Bot Token? → @BotFather
- ✅ Which Whisper model size for MVP? → base (recommended)
- ✅ Database choice for MVP? → SQLite with PostgreSQL migration path

### Current Questions
- What's the optimal batch size for Alembic migrations?
- Should we cache Whisper model in memory or reload?
  - **Decision**: Cache in memory, load once at startup
- How to handle graceful shutdown with active transcriptions?
  - **Approach**: Queue.join() + worker cancellation with timeout
- Test strategy for Whisper integration (mock vs. real model)?
  - **Approach**: Mock for unit tests, real model for integration tests

### Future Questions
- VPS provider preference? (DigitalOcean, Hetzner, Linode?)
- SSL certificate approach? (Let's Encrypt, Cloudflare?)
- Monitoring solution? (Prometheus + Grafana, or simpler?)

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### Project State
- **Phase**: Project Setup Complete → Moving to Database Layer
- **Confidence Level**: **90%** - Strong foundation, clear roadmap
- **Risk Level**: Low - Well-planned, proven technologies
- **Velocity**: Good - Setup phase completed efficiently

## Notes for Next Session

**Where We Left Off**: Project structure is complete, configuration system implemented, ready to begin database model implementation.

**Start Next Session With**:
1. Create database models in `src/storage/models.py`
2. Setup Alembic for migrations
3. Implement repository pattern
4. Write database tests

**Critical Path**: Database → Whisper → Queue → Bot Handlers → Integration

**Key Success Factor**: We have solid foundation with modern dependencies (faster-whisper 1.2.0, python-telegram-bot 22.5, SQLAlchemy 2.0.44) and clear architecture. The hybrid queue approach gives us room to grow without overengineering.

**Memory Bank Status**: ✅ All core files exist and are up-to-date. Ready for ongoing updates as implementation progresses.
