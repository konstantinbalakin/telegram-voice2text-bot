class Usage(Base):
    user_id, voice_duration, transcription_text, created_at

class Transaction(Base):  # Future billing
    user_id, amount, quota_added, status

# 2. Setup Alembic
alembic init alembic
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "initial schema"
alembic upgrade head

# 3. Implement repositories
UserRepository, UsageRepository with async methods

# 4. Write tests
test_database.py, test_repositories.py
```

```python
# src/transcription/whisper_service.py
class WhisperService:
    - Model initialization (faster-whisper)
    - Thread pool executor (max 3 workers)
    - async transcribe() with timeout
    - Error handling

## Open Questions (Implementation Phase)

### Answered ✅
- ✅ Where to get Telegram Bot Token? → @BotFather
- ✅ Which Whisper model size for MVP? → base (recommended)
- ✅ Database choice for MVP? → SQLite with PostgreSQL migration path

### Current Questions
- What's the optimal batch size for Alembic migrations?
- Should we cache Whisper model in memory or reload?
  - **Decision**: Cache in memory, load once at startup
- How to handle graceful shutdown with active transcriptions?
  - **Approach**: Queue.join() + worker cancellation with timeout
- Test strategy for Whisper integration (mock vs. real model)?
  - **Approach**: Mock for unit tests, real model for integration tests

### Future Questions
- VPS provider preference? (DigitalOcean, Hetzner, Linode?)
- SSL certificate approach? (Let's Encrypt, Cloudflare?)
- Monitoring solution? (Prometheus + Grafana, or simpler?)

## Important Patterns & Preferences

## Notes for Next Session

**Where We Left Off**: Bot successfully launched locally (2025-10-15). All components initialized and polling Telegram API. Ready for real-world testing with actual voice messages.

**Test Plan for Next Session**:
1. Send `/start` command to bot → Verify welcome message and user registration
2. Send `/help` command → Verify instructions displayed
3. Send voice message → Verify transcription returned
4. Send `/stats` command → Verify usage statistics displayed
5. Check database → Verify User and Usage records created
6. Test edge cases:
   - Large voice message (near 300-second limit)
   - Multiple voice messages in sequence
   - Audio file (non-voice) message

**Git Workflow**: All PRs merged to main. Working directly on main for testing phase.

**Critical Path**: ~~Database~~ ✅ → ~~Whisper~~ ✅ → ~~Bot Handlers~~ ✅ → ~~Local Launch~~ ✅ → Real Testing → Queue (optional) → Docker

**Current State**:
- Code: ✅ Complete for MVP
- Tests: ✅ 45+ unit tests passing
- Launch: ✅ Bot running locally
- Integration: ⏳ Needs real-world validation

**Key Success Factor**: Bot launches successfully with all components integrated. All unit tests pass. Ready for end-to-end functional testing with real Telegram voice messages.

**Memory Bank Status**: ✅ Updated with Session #6 results (bot launch verification). Accurate state preserved.
